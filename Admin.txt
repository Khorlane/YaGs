1.1 Introduction

YaGs is an original work written in C and is available on GitHub at https://github.com/Khorlane/YaGs.
It is a multiplayer game that allows players to explore a virtual world, interact with
other players, and engage in various activities. The game is designed to be text-based,
making it accessible to a wide range of players. As an administrator, you have the
ability to manage players, control game settings, and ensure a smooth gaming experience.
YaGs is designed to be user-friendly, and this guide will help you navigate the
administrative features available to you.

1.2 Execution Environment

YaGs is executed in a terminal environment. It requires a C compiler to build the game
and a terminal to run it. The game is designed to be run on a server, allowing multiple
players to connect and interact with each other in real-time. The game files are organized
into several directories, including the World folder for game data, the Library folder for
help files, and the Player folder for player data. The game uses a player file named
Player.yags, which contains information about all players in the game. This file is
located in the World folder and is essential for managing player data. The game also
uses a Help.txt file located in the Library folder, which provides players with information
about the game, including commands, rules, and other important details.

1.3 Operating System

YaGs is designed to run on Unix-like operating systems, including Linux and macOS.
It is not compatible with Windows without modifications. The game relies on standard
C libraries and terminal capabilities, making it suitable for environments that support
text-based applications. The game can be compiled using a C compiler such as GCC or Clang,
and it is recommended to run it in a terminal that supports ANSI escape codes for color
and formatting. The game is designed to be lightweight and efficient, allowing it to run
on a wide range of hardware, from low-end systems to more powerful servers. The game
is also designed to be modular, allowing for easy updates and modifications to the game
world, player data, and other game settings. The game uses a simple file structure,
making it easy to navigate and manage. The main game executable is located in the root
directory of the YaGs project.

player to log into the game is the admin.
